Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform 
for managing containerized workloads and services, 
that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation

Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014

------> Evolution of deployments

// old tradition
Hardware -> OS -> [App1, App2]

// virtualized deployments
// Each VM will work as a seperate OS on a virtualized hardware
// VMs eat up lots of resources
Hardware -> OS -> Hypervisor -> {VM_1 -> [App1, App2], VM_2 -> [App3] }

// Container deployments
// Containers are isolated but shares the OS, they are lightweight
Hardware -> OS -> Container Runtime -> { Container1, Container2 }

-------> Upside with container deployments

1. Dev and Ops are decoupled -> developer releases an image, devOps team can deploy it
2. Easy to create build images and versions
3. Best resourse utilisation and isolation
4. Loosely coupled tiny apps - health monitoring at app level
5. Cloud-friendly


----------> How Kubernetes can help us ----------

Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently
resilient => withstand containers/servers going down, and spinning up new ones

----> What all Kubernetes offers
1. load balancing on containers - health check and load distribution
2. service recovery
3. storage orchestration - it can automatically allocate and mount new storages
4. automated rollouts or rollbacks
5. Self-healing - restarts/replaces containers on failure
6. Secrets and configurations are well managed - API keys or env variables can be updated
    even after the deployment, and they are secure
