-----------> Kubernetes Components -------------------------------

When you deploy Kubernetes, you get a cluster.

Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines --> called nodes
nodes --> run containerized applications (inside Pods). 
Every cluster has at least one worker node.

A control plane --> manages the worker nodes, desicion maker (The brain)
Pods --> A set of running containers


---> components in Control Plane
1. kube-apiserver => Exposes api
2. etcd => key-value store for cluster data, highly available+consistent
3. kube-scheduler => watches pods, assigns nodes to newly created Pods
4. kube-cotroller-manager
5. cluster-controller-manager

---> Components inside a node
1. kubelet => agent watching the pods and Containers
2. kube-proxy => network proxy for the node machine
3. container runtime => Eg:- Docker, containerd, CRI-O

---> Kubernetes Addons (Integrations with external tools)

cluster DNS
Web UI (Dashboard)
container resource monitoring
cluster level logging
